# Testing Hybrid-QCNN's on Standard Computer Vision Datasets
Research has proven that various hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (hybrid QCNN) can outperform classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on a variety of tasks. However, there is a severe lack of research on hybrid QCNNs performance on feature rich data for various tasks such as classification or segmentation. In this paper, we aim to determine if a hybrid QCNN architecture that outperforms a CNN on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset can successfully outperform a CNN on classifying images from the feature rich ImageNet-1k dataset. This is achieved by training both the hybrid QCNN and CNN architectures on the ImageNet-1k dataset and perform hyperparamter tuning and ansatz architecture modifications to finalize classification accuracy. This would determine if hybrid QCNNs as they are today have the potential to replace classical CNNs. It is noted that although the hybrid QCNN used, HQNNQuanv performs better (24%) than its classical counterpart (23%) with similar parameters by 1%, the time taken to train the hybrid QCNN is relatively humongous (<3 minutes for the CNN vs ∼3 hours for the hybrid QCNN) possibly due to lack of hardware optimization. Thus, it is concluded that there exists potential for the real world application of hybrid QCNNs in the far future.
